# John Conway's Game of Life

## Intro

Conway's Game of Life is a type of computer simulation known as a cellular automaton, devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. Cellular automaton are essentially mathematical models of complex systems important to many fields of study including mathematics, biology, physics, and chemistry.

## Rules

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
